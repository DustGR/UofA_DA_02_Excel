HomeworkVBA.bas contains three subroutines.
AllSheets() should activate each worksheet in the workbook and run TotalPage()
When TotalPage() is done, it will run CheckTotals() to add the summary on the right side of the excel sheet

The program requires the data to be sorted by Ticker name, then by date(so open and close can be determined).
It gives a warning of this when it is run, but I did NOT set the AllSheets() sub to automatically sort the sheets.
